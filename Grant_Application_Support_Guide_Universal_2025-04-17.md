## Overview

This guide outlines the process and best practices for supporting grant applications within organizations. Whether you're working on government-funded initiatives or private foundation proposals, this document helps ensure technical documentation aligns with grantor expectations and compliance requirements.

## Purpose

To enable project managers, researchers, and administrative staff to:
- Prepare high-quality documentation for grant proposals
- Ensure data integrity, accuracy, and compliance with application requirements
- Streamline the review, submission, and follow-up process

## Target Audience

- Technical Writers supporting grant submissions
- Research & Development teams
- University departments or nonprofits seeking funding
- Administrative teams handling proposal logistics

---

## Pre-Migration Preparation

Before starting your grant application, establish the following:

- **Proposal Lead**: Assign a responsible project lead to own the documentation.
- **Grant Requirements**: Review the funderâ€™s specific documentation format, technical appendices, and submission platform.
- **Timeline**: Create a submission schedule including internal review dates and deadlines.
- **Previous Submissions**: Gather previously successful (or rejected) proposals for benchmarking.

---

## Gathering Required Information

Collect and verify the following data points:

- Legal Organization Name, Address, and Contact Information
- EIN or Registration ID
- Budget breakdown (projected and past usage if renewing)
- Project description (including objectives, methodology, timeline, and outcomes)
- Letters of support or partner organization details
- Technical platform and data handling/security policies if applicable

---

## Drafting Strong Grant Proposals

When writing or reviewing technical sections, ensure:

- **Plain language**: Explain technical concepts clearly for non-expert reviewers
- **Alignment**: Match the language and framing to the grant's goals and values
- **Conciseness**: Use bulleted lists and brief, focused sections
- **Data**: Support all claims with up-to-date metrics or citations

Sample structure:
```
Goal: Expand access to telehealth services in underserved communities  
Solution: Integrate a scalable, HIPAA-compliant platform with local clinics  
Outcomes: Expect to serve 2,000+ new patients over 12 months  
```

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Missing required attachments | Use a checklist to track document uploads |
| Overly technical language | Have non-expert staff review drafts |
| Inconsistent project metrics | Create a central source-of-truth document |
| Last-minute submissions | Set internal deadlines 5 business days before actual due date |

---

## Final Review & Submission Process

1. Proofread for clarity, grammar, and formatting
2. Cross-check all data points against official sources
3. Verify file types, character limits, and platform upload rules
4. Submit ahead of deadline and confirm receipt
5. Store a local PDF copy with timestamp
