## Purpose
This document provides a quick guide for users who want to add custom markers to a map using the Google Maps interface. It is structured to ensure clear and successful execution of the task, even by non-technical users.

## Target Audience
- Small business owners
- Event planners
- Educators and administrators
- Students and hobbyists using Google Maps

## Before You Begin
- Make sure you’re logged into your Google account.
- Use a desktop browser for the most accessible experience.
- Prepare the address or coordinates of the location you want to mark.

## Steps to Add a Marker
1. **Go to [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com)**  
   Navigate to the map area where you want to add the marker.

2. **Right-click the exact spot on the map**  
   A context menu will appear.

3. **Click “Add a Label” or “What’s here?”**  
   Depending on the version, you may see one or both options.

4. **Use the coordinates or place details shown in the bottom panel**  
   You can now click “Save” and add the point to a custom list or starred places.

5. **(Optional) Create a custom map in “My Maps”**  
   For advanced marker and color customization, go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/).

## Troubleshooting
| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Can’t find the option | Zoom in further; marker options only appear when you’re close enough |
| No “My Maps” link | Ensure you are signed into your Google account |

## Conclusion
Adding markers is a fast and efficient way to personalize your navigation or share custom points with others. For more advanced uses (like route planning or heatmaps), consider exploring Google’s developer tools or Map APIs.
